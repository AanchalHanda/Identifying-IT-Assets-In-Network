# Identifying-IT-Assets-In-Network
This project focuses on retrieving information about the systems that are in network .
It is a part of my intern as a summer trainee at O.N.G.C dehradun.
Given the problem statement a network was established among the systems and then for a given ip address range all the possible information was retrived about the systems present in the network and stored in a database.Initially the inspiration was taken from software called Nmap later using WMI(for windows)commanda were used to achieve all the information.
